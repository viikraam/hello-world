# hello-world

My name is Vik. 

I just moved to Knoxville, TN, from Laramie, WY, where is graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Physics and Astronomy from the University of Wyoming earlier this summer. My girlfriend Samantha moved with me. 

I'm here on an internship through Flibe Energy to work on a Nuclear Engineering project with Dr. Ondrej Chvala. I will be using Github to post code from my project related to the development of Molten Salt Reactors. This should be fun!
